IBM i2 Intelligence Analysis Platform Developer Essentials
==========================================================

IBM i2 Intelligence Analysis Platform Developer Essentials contains tools, libraries, and examples that enable development and deployment of custom extensions to the Intelligence Analysis Platform.

Developer Essentials includes API documentation that integrates with the Eclipse development environment. In addition, there are guides to deploying the software and the example projects.

-   [Deploying IBM i2 Intelligence Analysis Platform Developer Essentials](developer_essentials_deploying.md)

     IBM i2 Intelligence Analysis Platform Developer Essentials is a set of files and example projects that build on the standard Deployment Toolkit. You can deploy Developer Essentials on a single workstation.
-   [Configuring the "data load direct" example project](developer_essentials_example_dld.md)

     The "data load direct" approach to data acquisition in the Intelligence Analysis Platform involves importing external data into the Analysis Repository. In Developer Essentials, IBM provides the `da-arload-filesystem-example` example, in which the external data source is an XML file.
-   [Configuring the "data load ELP stage" example project](developer_essentials_example_delps.md)

     The "data load ELP stage" approach to data acquisition in the Intelligence Analysis Platform involves importing external data into an additional, semi-permanent data store. In Developer Essentials, IBM provides the `da-elpsload-filesystem-example` example, in which the external data source is an XML file.
-   [Configuring the "data access on-demand" example project](developer_essentials_example_daod.md)

     The "data access on-demand" approach to data acquisition in the Intelligence Analysis Platform involves querying external data through a new service on the read side of the platform. In Developer Essentials, IBM provides the `da-subset-filesystem-example` example, in which the external data source is an XML file.
-   [Troubleshooting the example projects](developer_essentials_troubleshooting.md)

     The example projects in Intelligence Analysis Platform Developer Essentials are sensitive to changes or inconsistencies in the configuration of the Eclipse IDE. The errors that you see can be cryptic, but there are standard approaches to resolving the problems that they identify.
-   [Publishing a custom application to a live deployment](developer_essentials_going_live.md)

     After you develop and test an extension for the Intelligence Analysis Platform, the next stage is to publish it to a live deployment. The procedure varies a little depending on the type of extension that you created.
